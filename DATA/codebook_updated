Diabetes Prediction Dataset from the Pima Indian Tribe and the NIDDK

A data frame with 768 observations on 16 variables, with significant missing data for some predictor variables.

This dataset was collected with funding from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK). The Pima Indian tribe located near Phoenix, Arizona (USA) has a very high rate of type 2 diabetes. This dataset includes a number of variables predictive of diabetes, and the outcome of a type 2 diabetes diagnosis within 5 years of the initial measurements. This dataset includes only females of at least 21 years of age, and of Pima Indian heritage, with at least 5 years of followup in a longitudinal study of diabetes.

NOTE: The dataset has been transformed to a tidy format September 11, 2024. 

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) is associated with obesity and a diet high in sugars and low in vegetables. People with type 2 DM become less sensitive to insulin, so that after a glucose load, their blood glucose and insulin rise, but the glucose level does not fall as quickly as it should, leading to sustained elevations in glucose and insulin. The incidence of type 2 DM is rising in many western cultures, as increasingly unhealthy and calorie rich diets become common.

The primary analysis task is to classify in each participant whether diabetes developed within 5 years of data collection (diabetes_5_year = pos), or the participant tested repeatedly negative for diabetes over the next 5 years (diabetes_5_year = neg).
